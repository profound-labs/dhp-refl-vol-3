With an image of liberation as the goal\\
the wise abandon darkness and cherish light,\\
leave petty security behind \\
and seek freedom from attachment.\\
To pursue such release is difficult and rare, \\
yet the wise will seek it, \\
detaching themselves from obstructions,\\
purifying heart and mind.

{\smaller Dhammapada verses 87-88}
