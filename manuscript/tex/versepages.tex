\label{dhp-85}
Few are those who reach the beyond.\\
Most pace endlessly back and forth,\\
not daring to risk the journey.
\end{dhpVerse}

\begin{dhpRefl}
To imagine anything truly new is not really possible. Most of what we think is a rearrangement of the past. If our goal is `the beyond,' freedom from suffering, we need a distinctly new approach. The predictability of what we find familiar can make us feel safe, even if it is tedious. This is the endlessly pacing back and forth. And this is how we live with clinging. What would it be like to not-cling; to trust in here-and-now awareness, informed by Dhamma? It takes courage to let go of the familiar and open up to the unknown. Our commitment to the precepts and our training in mindfulness are our protectors. With these in place we can dare to take this new journey.
