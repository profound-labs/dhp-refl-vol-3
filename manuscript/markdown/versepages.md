{:.dhp-verse #page1}

We all know the Buddha praised the cultivation of awareness. But how do
we know the right thing to be aware of in any given moment? The objects
are so varied: sights, sounds, smells, tastes, sensations and mental
impressions. One exercise in awareness could be simply attending to the
changing, unstable nature of all things, until we start to see them as
unreliable, not really worth clinging to. This is to be aware of the
characteristic of the ‘contents’ of experience. What happens if we
direct awareness towards the ‘context’ of experience? Is the
characteristic of the context in which all objects of attention manifest
the same?

> *v. 166*
{:.dhp-verse #page2}

At first glance this verse could sound as if we are being taught not to
care about others, but the Buddha is really pointing to where the right
emphasis in our practice lies. If there is an oxygen shortage in an
aeroplane, the captain tells the passengers to put on their own masks
first, before attempting to help others. This is not to stop parents
helping their children, but so that they can help them. Under stress we
can lose perspective and act in ways that make things worse. The Buddha
saw how easily distracted and confused unenlightened people could
become, and when he had announced he was dying, he said that those who
were serious about honouring him would not concern themselves with
bringing him flowers. Instead they would intensify their focus on
practising what he had taught.
{:.dhp-reflection}


> If you walk the path,\\

> I proclaim the Way which removes all thorns.

> *v. 275*
{:.dhp-verse #page3}

Life hurts. The most natural thing is to seek a way of being in this
world that is free from hurt. Those who have walked this way before us
speak about the indescribable sense of relief on reaching the land of
freedom, but they also point out that to reach it requires skilful
effort. The Buddha delivered this verse to a group of monks as they were
chatting about a trip they had been on together. He directed the
discussion away from talk concerning the roads and rivers they had
crossed, towards consideration of their inner terrain. The Teacher
advises us to use our limited time and energy in a way that takes us in
the direction we most want to go.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Just as a fletcher shapes an arrow,\\
> so the wise develop the mind;\\
> so excitable, uncertain\\
> and difficult to control.
>
> *v. 33*
{:.dhp-verse #page4}

Bringing body and mind in line with that which is true calls for a
special kind of skill. Just when we thought we had our spiritual
practice in order, we trip and fall again. But it doesn’t matter if we
stumble from time to time. Learning to walk is like that, falling over
is part of it. The skill worth developing is the agility which finds us
readily picking ourselves up and beginning again; without looking back.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Those who cease\\

>
> *v. 418*
{:.dhp-verse #page5}

Liking and disliking can happen so quickly that we may feel we have no
control over them. Somebody says something pleasant and we like them.
Another person says something hurtful and we dislike them. It might be
true that we can’t stop liking and disliking arising, but if we slow
down a little we might notice that in fact we do have a choice; whether
or not to follow the liking or disliking, whether or not to make a ‘me’
out of them. When awareness is well established, liking and disliking
can be seen as movement taking place in a larger reality. What is that
reality?
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Life is not easy for those\\
> who have a sense of shame,\\
> who are modest, pure-minded and detached,\\
> morally upright and reflective.
>
> *v. 245*
{:.dhp-verse #page6}

If we find ourselves thinking, ‘This is just too much, I can’t let go of
this one’, we need to be extra careful. It is easy to let go of minor
attachments, but the really serious ones are a different story. The
Buddha knew about that different story, the one we tend to believe when
faced with deep attachments. But the truth is still the truth, no matter
how hard it feels; all suffering is rooted in attachment, which is why
the Buddha gave us teachings like this verse. It really is hard to
remain true when the forces of delusion pull at us. Whether it is the
outer influences of sense objects or the inner currents of conditioning
which tell us we are weak and unable, we resolutely seek the power to
override those forces by turning to the Refuges. This is not just
replacing a negative story with a positive one, but calling on reality
to be our refuge.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> To avoid bringing harm to living beings\\
> who, like us, seek contentment,\\
> is to bring happiness to ourselves.
>
> *v. 132*
{:.dhp-verse #page7}

Sometimes what we do leads to happiness. At other times what we don’t do
leads to happiness. Here the Buddha is saying that we should be aware of
how the effort not to harm living beings brings happiness, not just for
those who therefore live free from fear and pain, but also for
ourselves. In a world where our worth is often measured in terms of our
productivity, we can become caught in feeling that we always have to do
something to make things better. At times, though, it is restraint that
matters most.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> All pollution is cleared\\
> from the minds of those who are vigilant,\\
> training themselves day and night,\\
> and whose lives are fully intent upon liberation.
>
> *v. 226*
{:.dhp-verse #page8}

If we are confident about the path and direction in which we are
travelling, we won’t spend time in aimless wandering. Hence the
teachings encourage us to be vigilant. Energy and devotion to spiritual
practice are not enough, however. Our lives need to be directed towards
the right goal: experiencing for ourselves the state of perfect freedom
from suffering. As we travel along the path, we can check to see whether
our progress and direction are correct by observing the pollutions of
mind. Greed, ill will, laziness, anxiety, hesitation: are they
diminishing or are they increasing? We get to know the reality of the
pollutions as and when they appear. We will learn about their
disappearance, here and now, in the same way.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> By endeavour, vigilance,\\
> restraint and self-control,\\
> let the wise make islands of themselves\\
> which no flood can overwhelm.
>
> *v. 25*
{:.dhp-verse #page9}

It may seem at times as if the Buddha contradicts himself. He teaches us
to focus on developing loving-kindness towards all beings, but here he
appears to be saying we should isolate ourselves. But all the Buddha’s
teachings are ‘pointings’; they are not fixed positions. He was often
asked to state where he stood in relation to a particular philosophical
view. In all cases he tried to avoid giving the questioner any view to
cling to. He didn’t stand on anything; he accorded with Dhamma as it
manifested. The path he taught is *Dhammavicaya*, investigation of
reality. He said that he could only point the way; it is up to us to
travel the way he showed.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Hasten to cultivate wisdom.\\
> Make an island for yourself.\\
> Freed from stain and defilement\\
> you will enter noble being.
>
> *v. 236*
{:.dhp-verse #page10}

We arrive at the state of noble being when we are at one with who we
truly are. Our work is to recognize when we become false, pretending to
be something or somebody we are not. Stains and defilements appear when
we believe in the stories the mind tells us. If we feel resentment, we
simply need to see the feeling of resentment clearly. If we feel fear,
we simply need to see that feeling clearly. We don’t need to pretend. We
‘make an island’ for ourselves by establishing awareness as the
foundation in our life. This clear-seeing awareness can tell the
difference between the real and the false, leading to freedom.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Like the tongue that can appreciate\\
> the flavour of the soup\\
> is one who can clearly discern the truth\\
> after only a brief association with the wise.
>
> *v. 65*
{:.dhp-verse #page11}

The number of retreats we go on is not as important as our ability to
discern truth. The amount of time we spend sitting in meditation does
not matter as much as our ability to see clearly what is in front of us.
If our awareness is here-and-now, whole body-mind, and judgement-free,
we can learn from all aspects of our life. If we have the good fortune
to encounter wisdom in any form, we will recognize it. It won’t have to
appear Buddhist, up to date or even overtly wise. The heart will simply
know it and be gladdened.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> While in the midst\\
> of those who are troubled,\\
> to dwell free from troubling\\
> is happiness indeed.
>
> *v. 198*
{:.dhp-verse #page12}

When those around us are struggling, we might feel that somehow it is
not quite right to be happy. The Buddha tells us the opposite. An
external display of excessive delight would be out of place, but
maintaining inner joy is perfectly suitable. In fact, to do so might be
the very best thing we could offer to a troubled situation.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Strength of patience\\
> is the might of noble beings;\\
> they can be shackled,\\
> endure verbal abuse and beatings\\
> without resorting to anger.
>
> *v. 399*
{:.dhp-verse #page13}

The force of self-righteousness within us needs taming. The more clever
we are, the more careful we need to be. The more eloquent our speech,
the more restraint is required. It is only when we know we can say ‘no’
to ourselves, when we know we don’t always have to be the winner, that
we can appreciate the transforming power of patient endurance.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> These three ways\\
> lead to radiant abiding:\\
> asserting the truth,\\
> not yielding to anger\\
> and giving, even if you have only a little to share.
>
> *v. 224*
{:.dhp-verse #page14}

We are the creators of the world. Our actions of body, speech and mind
give form to the space we inhabit. Investing in inner awareness
liberates us from dependence on the material world. The outer conditions
of our life come and go: sometimes they are agreeable and rewarding, at
other times wearisome and disappointing. But we can always make the
effort to speak truth. We can always wait before succumbing to anger.
And no matter how much or how little we own, we can always give. Thus we
already have the power to create a beautiful abiding.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Those who live impeccably,\\
> who are discerning, intelligent and virtuous –\\
> they are continually praised by the wise.\\
> Who would cast blame on those\\
> who in their being are like gold?\\
> Even the gods praise them.
>
> *v. 229-230*
{:.dhp-verse #page15}

Who do we compare ourselves with? The mental habit of comparing
ourselves with others is mostly an expression of inner confusion,
leading to more unhappiness. For the radiance of our true being to shine
freely, all compulsive comparing must cease, but while we are still
suffering from this habit it doesn’t help if we merely hold images of
those more popular, wealthy or beautiful in our mind. It is better to
compare ourselves with those who live impeccably, those who are more
awake. Some of the Buddha’s greatest disciples were neither popular nor
beautiful, but were greatly admired by all who could see clearly.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Bemoaning your own lot or envying the gains of others\\
> obstructs peace of mind.\\
> But being contented even with modest gains,\\
> pure in livelihood and energetic,\\
> you will be held in high esteem.
>
> *v. 365-366*
{:.dhp-verse #page16}

This simple truth easily escapes us. Sadly, we are too quick to admire
and emulate those who are not particularly wise. Here a very wise
Teacher is holding up a mirror and asking, ‘Do you see what you are
doing? Can you understand why you are unhappy?’ He is not criticizing or
condemning us, but neither is he letting us get away with our habits.
Out of compassion, he urges us to see the consequences of our
unawareness. At times it can appear that there is always something more
we need to do, to gain, to get rid of. Even the spiritual life can seem
like a tedious treadmill. Always believing in the way things seem,
however, is not the way to peace. Contentment could take the place of
self-pity if we stop heedlessly comparing ourselves with others.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Do not rest contented because you keep\\
> all the rules and regulations,\\
> or because you achieve great learning.\\
> Do not feel satisfied because you attain meditative absorption,\\
> or because you can dwell in the bliss of solitude.\\
> Only when you arrive at the complete eradication\\
> of all ignorance and conceit should you be content.
>
> *v. 271-272*
{:.dhp-verse #page17}

Reading or hearing such profound teaching might give rise to a sense of
urgency in practice – or it might cause us to give up because we feel we
can’t do it. How we engage with ideals determines whether we are
strengthened or weakened by them; the ideals themselves are not
responsible. It matters that our ideals should accord with Truth, but it
also matters that we shouldn’t mistake an image of the goal for the goal
itself. The Buddha wanted us to aim high; as high as can be and then
further, but he didn’t want us to grasp the ideal and ignore our
lowliness. Like a compass, the image of the goal offers direction – but
of course, we don’t keep our eyes constantly on the compass. So long as
we are heading in the right direction, we practise with that which is
directly in front of us.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> A master is one who has let go\\
> of all craving and clinging to the world;\\
> who has seen the truth beyond forms,\\
> yet is possessed of a profound knowledge of words.\\
> Such a great being can be said to have finished the task.
>
> *v. 352*
{:.dhp-verse #page18}

Letting go is not something we do, it is something which happens when we
see how what we do causes suffering. So long as we are caught in trying
to let go, the ‘me’ which is trying creates imbalance. But not trying
isn’t correct either. What can we do to fulfil the great task of finding
freedom? What does it mean to make right effort? One aspect of right
effort is examining the kind of effort we are already making. Is what we
are doing a form of self-seeking, or does it come from a deeper, quieter
place, a simple interest in what is true? We know we want to be free
from suffering, but does our way of wanting that freedom actually help?
Even wanting to be free can create obstructions if we cling to it. Our
aspiration to see ‘the truth beyond forms’ can support right effort if
we slow down, remember kindness and examine how we are receiving our
present experience.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> As an elephant\\
> resolutely drags itself from a swamp,\\
> uplift yourself with the inspiration\\
> of cultivated attention.
>
> *v. 327*
{:.dhp-verse #page19}

The energy of inspiration can be generated by wise reflection. With the
right kind of effort insurmountable situations can be managed, the
unendurable can be endured. Inspiration has the power to transform our
lives and our world. When wise reflection shows us that heedfulness
helps and heedlessness hinders; our hearts respond by inclining towards
the helpful. Balanced awareness rightly reveals the extent of the task
we have ahead of us, with our inner world obstructed by ignorance and
our outer world fraught with injustice. But the important question is
how we meet this task. What is needed is not more force, but careful
consideration of cause and effect. If clear seeing and kindness were to
motivate us, the swamp of heedless habits would appear less daunting.
Cultivated attention shows us what works, and confidence naturally
follows.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Those who arrive at the state of perfect freedom\\
> through right understanding\\
> are unperturbed in body, speech or mind.\\
> They remain unshaken by life’s vicissitudes.
>
> *v. 96*
{:.dhp-verse #page20}

The very best way to accommodate uncertainty is through right
understanding, or right view. To expect to be always at ease with
uncertainty would be naive, but we shouldn’t assume that we must be
defined by it. Life, change and all the rest of it might appear to be
too much, but life itself is never too much; it is always ‘just so’. If
it was really too much, the Buddha could never have realized freedom
while still alive. The view we hold is what makes the difference. If we
take ourselves too seriously the situation can seem intolerable; we
become tense, limiting possibilities for insight and sensitivity.
Instead we could try relaxing and imagining an unconditioned reality in
which all the changing conditions simply appear to arise and cease. Wise
letting go leads to an expanded awareness and a fresh perspective on
what we were doing which made it seem we had a problem.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> It is not easy to be born as a human being\\
> and to live this mortal life.\\
> It is not easy to have the opportunity to hear Dhamma\\
> and rare for a Buddha to arise.
>
> *v. 182*
{:.dhp-verse #page21}

In terms of here and now, we are born as human beings whenever we have
mindfulness and integrity. Because of our tendency to compromise Dhamma
principles, this task becomes difficult; following preferences is much
easier. However, merely to follow liking and disliking is not living as
we could be living. Instead we could reflect on cause and effect, on
what happened last time we allowed ourselves to become lost in
experience. We are fortunate these days to have ready access to Dhamma,
but the Dhamma is hard to hear because we have created obstructions by
having followed our preferences for so long. When the Buddha was alive,
some of his disciples became enlightened at once by simply listening as
he taught the Dhamma. Why can’t we listen in the same way, get the
message and drop the burden? If we did that, the ‘Buddha’ would appear
here and now.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Neither mother, father\\
> nor any other relative\\
> can give you the blessings generated\\
> by your own well-directed heart.
>
> *v. 43*
{:.dhp-verse #page22}

If the heart is well-directed, we feel there is something we can fall
back on when things get difficult. If we experience despair,
disappointment, disillusionment, the heart doesn’t have to sink into
hopelessness. Nor does it have to seek security in hope. The refuge we
can fall back on is not any thing or state at all; it is a way. Having
looked into the consequences of grasping for long enough, we now seek
confidence in letting go of fixed positions. We still have opinions and
preferences, but we are not so committed to finding security in them.
Learning to let go is the way to generate blessings.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> The Awakened Ones can but point the way;\\
> we must make the effort ourselves.\\
> Those who reflect wisely and enter the path\\
> are freed from the fetters of Mara.
>
> *v. 276*
{:.dhp-verse #page23}

‘What effort should I make? Should I do something about this situation
or simply watch my mind?’ Such moments of not-knowing are precious.
Uncertainty does not have to be seen as failing. Indeed, we might miss
something important if we are in a hurry to push past it. The fact is
that we don’t know what to do and there is not necessarily any fault in
that. If, however, we’re completely caught in the momentum of wanting to
escape suffering, we may miss learning from the truth of the situation
as it is. With the confidence that comes from our commitment to
precepts, we can afford to trust in being patient and aware of ‘not
knowing’ and the uncomfortable feelings that come with it. We can feel
the force of the momentum of wanting to get away from it, to ‘solve it’,
but stubbornly refuse to be pulled along. We can experiment with waiting
until the feeling of being driven subsides, and then quietly listen to
what intuition suggests we could do.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Disciples of the Buddha\\
> are fully awake,\\
> dwelling both day and night\\
> in contemplation of Reality.
>
> *v. 297*
{:.dhp-verse #page24}

What the Buddha and all his realized disciples awakened to, was the truth
that was right in front of them. Like many other millions of seekers, the
Buddha-to-be had been looking for the answers to his deep questions in
techniques and belief systems. The rigours of renunciation had even driven
him near to death; yet none of it had worked. What did work however was
renouncing all effort to avoid suffering, either by way of indulgence in
pleasure or indulgence in pain, and taking the experience of suffering
itself as his teacher. The Four Noble Truths taught by the Buddha are his
way of helping us not waste time. He wanted his disciples to awaken to the
truth that exists here and now; to discover for themselves the joy and
clarity which comes with Right Understanding.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> When those who are wise dwell in contemplation\\
> of the transient nature of the body-mind\\
> and of all conditioned existence,\\
> they experience joy and delight,\\
> seeing through to the inherently secure.
>
> *v. 374*
{:.dhp-verse #page25}

All the Buddha’s teachings point to that which is unchanging, undying,
inherently satisfactory. To wake up from the dream we live in, we dwell
in contemplation on the changing, dying, unsatisfactory nature of
conditioned existence. In our dream world we believe that attaching to
things as if they were ultimate will make us happy. With his ready
access to the unconditioned reality, the Buddha knew that clinging to
any aspect of conditioned reality was a direct route to disappointment.
He didn’t teach this so we would create a philosophy about how
unreliable and regrettable everything is. He lived in this world as we
do, but didn’t suffer and go on about how sad it all is. Life can seem
sad and regrettable so long as we are identified as the body-mind. The
Buddha’s identity was undefinable because he didn’t cling to anything,
and his happiness was unshakeable because it didn’t depend on anything.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Not insulting, not harming,\\

> *v. 185*
{:.dhp-verse #page26}

Modesty and contentment are not part of consumer culture, but they are
part of Buddhist culture. It is true that we need enthusiasm and energy,
commitment and concentration, if we wish to reach the goal of
liberation. But too much of these ‘hard virtues’ and we create
unnecessary obstructions for ourselves. When we are mindful, it is
possible that we will know if we are out of balance and adjust
accordingly. The ‘soft virtues’ of contentment, modesty, humility are
less attractive to our spiritual egos, but they might be just what is
needed for dropping the burden.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> … if you cannot find a good companion\\
> of integrity and wisdom,\\
> then, like a king departing a conquered land\\
> or a lone elephant wandering the forest,\\
> walk alone.
>
> *v. 329*
{:.dhp-verse #page27}

Integrity is the foundation of our practice. Without it nothing
develops. We might have eloquent speech, and perhaps our articles have
been published in popular journals or online, but if integrity is
lacking, practice hasn’t begun. Travelling the spiritual path alone is
not a sign of failure; it may mean quite the opposite. If those around
us are willing to compromise on impeccability, it is better for us to be
alone.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> In one whose mind is unsteady,\\
> whose heart is not prepared with true teachings,\\
> whose faith is not matured,\\
> the fullness of wisdom is not yet manifest.
>
> *v. 38*
{:.dhp-verse #page28}

This Dhammapada verse may describe many of us: brought up with spiritual
education, minds locked in thinking mode, and incapable of giving
ourselves whole-heartedly to anything. Yet we trust that real wisdom
exists and that we have a chance of realizing it. It is this ‘initial’
type of faith that got us started and brought us thus far. Now we must
build on it. Once we have tasted the benefits of practice, faith is
verified and manifests quite differently. It becomes a reliable source
of energy. In the beginning we were motivated by an idea or an
intuition. Now we are invited to trust in an awareness informed by
experience. This feels like spending money earned by our own efforts
rather than handed out by someone else.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> Though subtle, elusive and hard to see,\\

{:.dhp-verse #page29}

When we watch over this heart-mind we cultivate inner light. When light
in our outer world is dim we are inclined to trip over things, or
perhaps mistake a piece of rope for a snake and run away in a completely
unnecessary panic. Similarly, a lack of inner illumination can cause us
to react in ill-judged ways, destroying our heart’s natural sense of
ease. It is because we don’t see states of mind clearly that we react
and make things worse. For example, perhaps we still feel hurt by
something which happened years ago, and have dwelt on bitterness ever
since because we didn’t see the truth of our reaction. Forgiveness is
not a synthetic virtue with which to paste over our bruises. Although
the memory of what happened might remain, we always have the choice of
whether or not to invest that memory with resentment. This practice is
subtle and hard to see, but it is worth the effort.

{:.dhp-verse #page30}

The Buddha knows that life is not always easy. He knows that even the
practice of observing the five precepts can be difficult. The story
associated with this verse involves a group of five lay disciples who
are each observing one or two of the five Buddhist precepts. They each
insist that theirs is the most difficult to cultivate and therefore by
implication the most worthy. Arguing among themselves they approach the
Buddha, each wanting him to praise his own practice and support their
view that the precepts being kept are the most important. Instead the
Teacher admonishes them, saying that none of the precepts is easy to
keep, nor are any of them unimportant, and that everyone should train
themselves in all five.
{:.dhp-reflection}

{:.dhp-verse #page31}

Liberated beings are never fooled by the way things appear to be. They
know the difference between outer ‘form’ which the eye sees, and
‘actuality’ which the heart knows. They naturally respect and take
delight in the inherent beauty of the ‘real’. Our awareness, however, is
limited because of fixed views, and we must take care not to casually
follow our mind’s conditioning. So long as we are unaware of truth, we
are susceptible to being impressed by outer forms. Transient beauty,
intense emotions, wealth; all these and more intimidate us into
unhelpful desires, into wanting that which brings no lasting benefit.
Whenever we offer respect towards the truth which is beyond
intimidation, our affinity with that truth increases.
{:.dhp-reflection}

{:.dhp-verse #page32}

The Buddha gave this short teaching referring to conditions in the outer
world, and it is not difficult to agree. We can also contemplate the
spirit of this message with reference to our inner world; our mind
states. How does it feel when we generate foolish thoughts? What happens
when we cease to indulge in them? What is the effect of witnessing our
heart’s wholesome aspirations? Is it possible to dwell for extended
periods in noble intentions?
{:.dhp-reflection}

> From endearment springs grief.\\
> From endearment springs fear of loss.\\
> Yet if one is free from endearment\\

{:.dhp-verse #page33}

One way of reading this text is that we are wrong to hold things dear:
family, friends, memories. That initial interpretation blames the
feelings themselves for our suffering. But the Buddha is not just
talking about the feelings; he is pointing to how we might be free. Is
it possible to feel endearment and be free at the same time? When he
heard that his two chief disciples, Venerables Sariputta and Moggallana,
had died, the Buddha commented that it was as if the sun and the moon
had gone from the sky. That doesn’t sound like someone who didn’t feel
anything. Knowing the truth of feelings means that we no longer find our
sense of identity in them, but letting go of them does not mean they
disappear. In what are all these feelings arising and ceasing? That was
the Buddha’s abiding; hence he could feel fully and freely, without
suffering.
{:.dhp-reflection}

{:.dhp-verse #page34}

Listening to many hours of Dhamma talks might be helpful, but the Buddha
says that even one word of Dhamma can be enough. What matters is whether
that word truly touches our hearts. Does it ring true? Truth is what
heals us, not mere words. Living in a world that is distracted by
materialism, we often assume that more is better. Yet one small passport
can get us comfortably through immigration and is worth more than a
truckload of books. They are both paper – what is the difference? We
already know we need to attend to quality, not just quantity. This
Dhammapada verse encourages us to take our understanding deeper.

{:.dhp-verse #page35}

The first stage of cultivating the way is refraining from following all
that is evil. It is about learning to say ‘no’ to ourselves when we need
to. As a result, we discover later that we can say ‘yes’ without losing
ourselves. If we don’t recognize our unwholesome impulses for what they
are, we might think the bad stuff is only in other people. The second
stage of cultivating the way is developing that which is good. Even if
it is only a small moment of goodness, don’t dismiss it. The third stage
is purifying our effort from the taint of ‘me’. Even when we have
completely finished redecorating a room, the smell of paint fumes
remains. Though our practice might be growing stronger, the sense of
self-importance could be growing stronger too.

Physicians advise us to nourish the body by healthy eating and taking
regular exercise. The Buddha advises us to nourish the heart with Truth.
If we allow ourselves to become too busy, we forget how refreshing it
can be to spend time alone, to take time for ourselves, and a sense of
discontent gradually increases until we believe we are inherently
lacking. This perception might please the consumer culture, but it
doesn’t give us inner strength. Spiritual practice sometimes involves
daring to take less and trusting in our heart’s natural undefiled state.

{:.dhp-verse #page37}

Usually we equate happiness with getting what we want. Might there be
other forms of happiness? For all of us there are times when we don’t
get what we want, or we get what we definitely do not want. In this
verse the Buddha is pointing to a quality of happiness which arises
irrespective of whether or not we get what we want, a happiness which
arises with wisdom. Wisdom knows that some conditions can be changed and
some cannot. We can’t, for instance, stop others from feeling hatred,
but we can make the effort not to be pulled into their anger. And
despite what some may say, this is not quietism. It is taking
responsibility for what is ours and maintaining equanimity towards that
which is not.

{:.dhp-verse #page38}

Greatness could be defined in terms of the power we have or the
possessions we own, but in the mind of the Buddha it is better
determined by how people conduct themselves. This is a very practical
way of assessing how trustworthy people may be. Are they restrained in
how they act and in what they say? Are they kind? We can’t tell what is
happening inwardly, but we can observe the influence they have on the
world around them.

{:.dhp-verse #page39}

How can we know the right amount of things? Our senses and society often
tell us that we need more. The global economy is based on conditioning
us to believe we lack things. If our refuge is in an expanded awareness,
freed from the compulsive habit of taking sides, we are in a position to
contemplate the conditioning process. It is essential to recognize that
we don’t have to be enslaved by our environment. The work of inner
reflection can lead to a confidence independent of popular belief or
cultural bias. We are allowed to experiment with not eating so much or
having an opinion on everything. It’s fine to be quiet and cultivate
contentment. Contentment doesn’t have to mean abdication. What matters
is that when a storm strikes, does it blow us over? From where do we
draw our strength?

{:.dhp-verse #page40}

It is easy to criticize weakness in others. It is hard to recognize and
remedy faults within ourselves. At one level it can even feel good to
elevate ourselves as we put others down, but such feelings cannot be
trusted. One-upmanship is unlikely to contribute to harmony. Of course,
there are times when criticism is called for, but for it to be
constructive we must have wholesome intention. To know our intention
accurately probably means that we should slow down a little, wait and
listen inwardly before we speak.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> More than a thief,\\

> *v. 42*
{:.dhp-verse #page41}

A misdirected heart leads us to harm when it obstructs access to the
natural state of contentment. When awareness fails and we attach, the
act of clinging feeds into confused thinking and divisive action. True,
self-existing well-being arises effortlessly for those who are at one
with what is; with Dhamma. A liberated being doesn’t have to try to be
contented or not be discontented. Having seen the suffering caused by
clinging, all inclination to attach to fixed positions has gone. The
unobstructed heart leads only to understanding and ease.

{:.dhp-verse #page42}

If we were to stub our toe and not feel pain we would be in trouble.
Pain is a message saying, ‘Pay attention.’ Similarly, if we were to act
or speak cruelly without feeling remorse in our heart, we would be in
trouble. How could we learn? Despite appearances, remorse is not
something going wrong. It is there to protect us, a sort of immune
system. We can listen to it, accept it, invite the pain in our hearts to
teach us how not to follow heedlessness in future. Becoming lost in
remorse will lead to guilt; we’ve missed the point. We don’t learn by
taking delight in hating ourselves or others for making a mistake.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> To harm living beings who, like us, seek contentment,\\

> *v. 131*
{:.dhp-verse #page43}

Self-interest can be used in our pursuit of right action. When faced
with danger we easily feel threatened, our hearts become inflamed and
wise discernment is obscured. However, instead of losing ourselves in
defensive reaction, right training can help us remember that we are all
in this together. We all share the wish to be free from suffering.
Probably an aggressor has forgotten this fact, hence his intention to
harm us; but if we seek to harm him in return, only increased mutual
suffering ensues. Regular recollection on the universality of suffering
can protect us from falling into this vortex. Spending a short period of
time each day considering how we are all seeking contentment can give
rise to feelings of empathy and compassion. This is not an argument of
which we will be convinced by reflection alone, but if we immerse
ourselves in this contemplation we could find the benefit for ourselves.

{:.dhp-verse #page44}

We do have precious cargo, human consciousness. And we love life, hence
the effort we make to protect it. The Buddha is saying we should watch
over this good fortune which we have inherited by avoiding all evil
actions. Great benefit can be discovered in this life if we are careful
and cultivate wisdom. Similarly, great suffering can arise if we are
heedless. Evil is a strong word and we might prefer not to use it, but
we are naive not to contemplate it. When the heart is possessed by greed
or hatred, evil actions may follow. Once they are performed there will
be painful consequences. Nobody else can save us from heedlessness, not
even the Buddha. Through kindness and wise reflection we contribute to
the protection of all beings.

{:.dhp-verse #page45}

There are times when we need to be assertive, as our body’s immune
system is assertive when dealing with disease. But let’s not make our
only way of being. It can appear strong and impressive; it gets results;
but it has limitations. There are times when gentleness is what is
called for. Gentle speech which is true and encouraging also
produces results.
{:.dhp-reflection}

{:.dhp-verse #page46}

We sometimes need reminding that the causes of suffering, our own and
that of the world, are complex. Often it is not what is happening in the
outer world that leads to our struggles, but how we view things.
Assuming the validity of views and opinions just because they are
commonly held is not wise; convenient, perhaps, but that is not a good
reason to invest in them. It is simplistic to collude with collective
thinking without looking into the consequences. Having preferences is
natural, but clinging to them and finding identity by holding to them
leads to prejudice and disintegration, inwardly and outwardly.

{:.dhp-verse #page47}

Happiness is like food, it nourishes us. For happiness to be wholesome
and genuinely sustaining, however, our efforts must come with empathy.
Striving to be happy but lacking awareness of how we affect others is
short-sighted. We may think we are generating causes for well-being, but
in our hearts be harbouring jealousy or enmity.
{:.dhp-reflection}

{:.dhp-verse #page48}

Not only our bodies but all material objects are subject to the law of
impermanence, as are social structures, institutions, relationships and
organizations. Everything around us and within us is in a state of
perpetual flux. For the sake of their balanced development it is
necessary to protect children somewhat from this fact. For instance, we
don’t repeatedly remind them that their parents are mortal. But as we
grow up, sooner or later we must admit that this is really how it is.
Indeed, we need not just to admit this truth, but to embrace it, if we
wish to accord wisely with changing conditions. The Buddha identified
the law of impermanence as something beyond degeneration; something
stable and secure, a Truth to which we can turn to find a frame of
reference.

{:.dhp-verse #page49}

Empathy is the essence of harmony. Throughout our lives we depend to
varying degrees on others. If we forget that we all long for happiness
and fear harm we risk being dominated by self-centred concerns, but we
can learn to recognize that which we all share. Empathy supports insight
into selflessness. Through empathy we see that others too, like us, hope
not to be disappointed, and fear losing the things they hold dear. Even
the wish to cause harm to another is a form of suffering we share with
others. All those whose sense of identity comes from attaching to their
body-mind are obliged to endure disharmony and the distorted thoughts
and feelings which arise as a consequence. Letting go of attachment to
this body-mind and recognizing our identity in understanding means
disharmony simply won’t arise.
{:.dhp-reflection}

> *v. 92*
{:.dhp-verse #page50}

Can we do what we do so completely, so fully, that we leave no tracks
behind? Probably not. Our habits of clinging mean we tend to do things
partially. Our speech can be manipulative, leaving uncertainty behind.
Our actions can be self-seeking, leaving feelings of incompleteness
behind. And our thoughts can be all over the place, leaving us confused.
This subtle image of birds flying through the sky, with no tracks left
behind, inspires us to live without clinging. In making this effort we
align ourselves with those great beings who have done what needs to be
done, leaving nothing but Truth behind.

{:.dhp-verse #page51}

We can admire our Teacher, the Buddha, without abandoning who and what
we are right now. There are those who, when invited to dwell in
contemplation of the spiritual master, betray themselves in their
attempts to imitate another. The Buddha didn’t want us to ignore who we
feel ourselves to be and pretend to be somebody else; rather, he
encouraged an open-hearted, clear-minded receptivity of ‘this’ person,
here and now, including all our limitations and obsessions. Taking on a
new set of conditioned habits in an attempt to be free from suffering is
abdication, not liberation. In practice we include all of ourselves in a
vast field of awareness, free of discrimination and bias, and in so
doing we offer all of ourselves in service to Dhamma.

> *v. 285*
{:.dhp-verse #page52}

We will not free ourselves from attachments by holding to opinions about
how ‘life’ should be. ‘Life’ here refers to everything: self, others,
material possessions. Even religious opinions lead to suffering if we
cling to them in the wrong way. Freedom comes from recognizing how we
hold onto things as we are holding onto them. Why do we resist the
reality of change? Change is constant, yet we don’t see it. Walking the
Awakened One’s Way to liberation means examining our relationship to all
experience, agreeable and disagreeable. Every single moment of our life
is an opportunity to learn how to let go, let be and understand.
